<HR>
<H1>Redirection notice</H1>
<H2>The area you are trying to access is strictly 18+ and for such reason, you have been redirected</H2>
<H2>You were on the safe side of SNU, the part that anyone can view freely. Continuing here, you will go to the dirty side</H2>
<H3>If you really wish to continue, <a href="SNU_PORN_HOME.html">Click here</a></H3>
<HR>
<H2>Notice to organizations</H2>
<H3>We recommend blocking this particular part of the site from access to your workers. You can adjust this in your organization settings.</H3>
<H3>Reason: Pornographic content</H3>
<H2>Recommended to block at:</H2>
<H3>Schools, banks, libraries, etc</H3>
<HR>
<H2>Notice to parents</H2>
<H3>SNU is a friendly and clean environment. If you don't want your children being exposed to this at an early age, you can easily restrict access. It is not recommended to have this enabled for accounts belonging to people under the age of 18</H3>
<H3>Please block this part only, not SNU as a whole. Also make sure that your NSFW filter is on and set to the correct age. If you do not disable this before giving this to other family members, we are not responsible for any exposure they see, however we hope you take the time to disable this.</H3>
<HR>
<H2>If you are still unavailable to connect,</H2>
<H2>* check the status of SNU and make sure this part of SNU isn't down</H2>
<H2>* wait until you go to a different network, as this area may be blocked by your family or organization</H2>
